<br />
<p>
John is evaluating the details provided in the ticket to determine the urgency and impact of the issue on business operations. After assessing the situation, John uses established criteria to classify the ticket as high priority (Sev-A), ensuring that it receives immediate attention from the appropriate team. This systematic approach helps streamline the resolution process and ensures critical issues are addressed promptly.

<h3 align="center">Resolution</h3>
<br />
<p>
  Effective communication is crucial in resolving tickets as it ensures that all parties involved have a clear understanding of the issue and the steps being taken to address it. By maintaining open lines of communication, agents can collaborate more efficiently, share insights, and prevent misunderstandings that could delay the resolution process. Additionally, timely updates to the user help manage expectations and build trust in the support system. This concludes this tutorial on Ticket Lifecycle: Intake Through Resolution! ✧｡٩(ˊᗜˋ )و✧*｡
